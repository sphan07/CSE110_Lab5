1. Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “message” feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user. <br>
I would not because a message feature that would write and send a message to another user would consist of 2 features, making it difficult to use a unit test, which from this lab, we can see is rather small. Possibly, we could test how each function would work but not the functionality of it working together especially if we try to see it from the user/client side. <br>

2.Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “max message length” feature prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters. <br>Yes, compared to the test above, this test is rather simple, having a good constraint. This makes it easy to use a unit test for, checking to see if the 80 chracter limit works or not.
